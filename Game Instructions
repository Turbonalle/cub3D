Welcome to the Slimy Dungeon, a perilous maze of pulsating walls and lurking dangers. Your goal: escape to freedom through locked doors, each protected by a vibrant color-coded lock. Hunt for keys of matching colors to unlock your path, but beware of relentless slime blob enemies.

They hunger for your presence, and if they spot you, the chase is on. Fear not, for you have a secret weapon â€“ mushrooms. Grab them, toss them strategically, and watch as the slime blobs are lured away, leaving you a window to slip through unnoticed.

Navigate the slimy passages, collect keys, and outsmart your pursuers. Will you conquer the dungeon's challenges and emerge triumphant, or become the next meal for the slime blobs? The adventure begins now!
